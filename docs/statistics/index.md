# Statistics

**Statistics** is the science of learning from data. It provides tools to collect, analyze, interpret, and present data to make informed decisions. From A/B testing websites to analyzing scientific experiments, statistics helps us extract meaningful insights from the noise.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Measures

| Measure | Formula | Description | Use Case |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Mean** | $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | Average value | Central tendency |
| **Variance** | $s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ | Spread around mean | Variability measure |
| **Standard Deviation** | $s = \sqrt{s^2}$ | Average distance from mean | Scale of variation |
| **Correlation** | $r = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$ | Linear relationship strength | Association measure |

### Common Distributions

| Distribution | Probability Function | Parameters | Application |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Normal** | $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ | Î¼ (mean), Ïƒ (std dev) | Natural phenomena, errors |
| **Binomial** | $P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ | n (trials), p (success prob) | Yes/no outcomes |
| **Poisson** | $P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$ | Î» (rate) | Rare events, counts |
| **Exponential** | $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ | Î» (rate) | Wait times, lifetimes |

### Key Formulas

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- **Sample mean**: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$
- **Sample variance**: $s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$
- **Standard error**: $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

**Probability Rules:**
- **Addition rule**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- **Multiplication rule**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)$
- **Bayes' theorem**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$
