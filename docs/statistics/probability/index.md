# Probability Theory

Welcome to the fascinating world of probability! Think of probability as the mathematical language for describing uncertainty and randomness. Just like a weather forecast tells you the chance of rain, probability theory gives us tools to quantify and reason about uncertain events in everything from dice games to machine learning algorithms.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide to probability theory covers everything from basic concepts to advanced applications. Whether you're building machine learning models, conducting statistical analysis, or making data-driven decisions, understanding probability is essential for working with uncertainty.

### Core Topics Covered

- **Fundamental Concepts**: Sample spaces, events, probability axioms, and basic rules
- **Random Variables**: Discrete and continuous variables, expected values, and variance
- **Probability Distributions**: Normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential, and more
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Updating beliefs with new evidence
- **Real-World Applications**: A/B testing, risk assessment, quality control, and decision-making

## Quick Reference

### Essential Formulas

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Basic Probability: } & P(A) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}} \\
\text{Conditional: } & P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
\text{Bayes' Theorem: } & P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\
\text{Normal PDF: } & f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{align}
$$

### Common Distributions

| Distribution | Parameters | Use Cases |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Normal** | Œº (mean), œÉ (std dev) | Heights, test scores, measurements |
| **Binomial** | n (trials), p (success prob) | Success/failure experiments |
| **Poisson** | Œª (rate) | Event counts over time/space |
| **Exponential** | Œª (rate) | Waiting times, reliability |
