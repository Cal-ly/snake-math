## Quick Reference

### Essential Symbols

| Symbol | Name | Meaning | Example |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| **+** | Plus | Addition | $3 + 5 = 8$ |
| **-** | Minus | Subtraction | $7 - 2 = 5$ |
| **√ó** or **¬∑** | Times | Multiplication | $4 √ó 6 = 24$ |
| **√∑** or **/** | Divide | Division | $8 √∑ 2 = 4$ |
| **=** | Equals | Equality | $x = 5$ |
| **‚â†** | Not equal | Inequality | $3 ‚â† 7$ |

### Function Notation

| Notation | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **f(x)** | Function of x | $f(x) = 2x + 1$ |
| **f(3)** | Function value at x=3 | $f(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$ |
| **y = f(x)** | y is a function of x | Output depends on input |

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

1. **P**arentheses (and other grouping symbols)
2. **E**xponents (powers and roots)
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
