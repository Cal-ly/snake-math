# Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

Just like reading a sentence from left to right follows grammar rules, mathematical expressions follow specific rules about which operations to perform first. These rules prevent mathematical chaos and ensure everyone gets the same answer!

## Understanding Order of Operations

Order of operations is a set of rules that determines the sequence in which mathematical operations should be performed in an expression. Without these rules, the expression `2 + 3 × 4` could equal either 20 or 14 - and mathematics doesn't like ambiguity!

The standard order follows the PEMDAS/BODMAS hierarchy:

$$
\text{Parentheses/Brackets} \rightarrow \text{Exponents/Orders} \rightarrow \text{Multiplication/Division} \rightarrow \text{Addition/Subtraction}
$$

Think of it like getting dressed - you put on underwear before pants, socks before shoes. Mathematical operations have their own "getting dressed" routine:

```python
# Without parentheses: follows order of operations
result1 = 2 + 3 * 4  # 2 + (3 * 4) = 2 + 12 = 14

# With parentheses: overrides default order
result2 = (2 + 3) * 4  # (2 + 3) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20

# Complex expression demonstrating full hierarchy
result3 = 2 + 3 * 4 ** 2 - 1  # 2 + 3 * 16 - 1 = 2 + 48 - 1 = 49
```

## Why Order of Operations Matters for Programmers

Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct code and debugging expressions. A misplaced operator or missing parentheses can turn your elegant algorithm into a bug-hunting nightmare!

Programming languages implement mathematical order of operations, but they also add their own operators with specific precedence rules. Knowing these rules helps you write clearer code and avoid subtle bugs that only appear with certain input values.

## Order of Operations Techniques and Efficiency

Understanding how to work with operator precedence effectively prevents bugs and improves code readability.

### Method 1: Explicit Parentheses

**Pros**: Clear intent, eliminates ambiguity, self-documenting\
**Complexity**: O(1) for readability improvement

```python
def calculate_compound_formula(a, b, c, x):
    """Use explicit parentheses for clarity"""
    # Less clear: a + b * c ** 2 / x - 1
    # More clear: a + ((b * (c ** 2)) / x) - 1
    return a + ((b * (c ** 2)) / x) - 1
```

### Method 2: Breaking Complex Expressions

**Pros**: Easier debugging, improved readability, step-by-step validation\
**Complexity**: O(1) for each sub-expression

```python
def step_by_step_calculation(principal, rate, time, compounds):
    """Break complex financial calculation into steps"""
    # Instead of: amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounds)**(compounds*time)
    
    rate_per_period = rate / compounds
    periods_total = compounds * time
    growth_factor = 1 + rate_per_period
    compound_factor = growth_factor ** periods_total
    amount = principal * compound_factor
    
    return amount
```

### Method 3: Operator Overloading with Custom Precedence

**Pros**: Domain-specific languages, custom mathematical notation\
**Complexity**: O(1) for evaluation, O(n) for parsing

```python
class MathExpression:
    """Custom class demonstrating operator precedence control"""
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return MathExpression(self.value + other.value)
    
    def __mul__(self, other):
        return MathExpression(self.value * other.value)
    
    def __pow__(self, other):
        return MathExpression(self.value ** other.value)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MathExpr({self.value})"

# Custom precedence still follows Python's rules
a, b, c = MathExpression(2), MathExpression(3), MathExpression(4)
result = a + b * c  # Still evaluates as a + (b * c)
```


## Why Precedence Parsing Works

Operator precedence works by implementing a hierarchy that mirrors mathematical convention. Think of it as a well-organized filing system where more urgent operations get processed first:

```python
def evaluate_expression_step_by_step(expression_str):
    """Demonstrate manual precedence evaluation"""
    # Example: "2 + 3 * 4 ** 2"
    
    steps = []
    current = expression_str
    
    # Step 1: Handle exponents first (highest precedence)
    if "**" in current:
        # Find and evaluate 4 ** 2 = 16
        current = current.replace("4 ** 2", "16")
        steps.append(f"Exponents: {current}")
    
    # Step 2: Handle multiplication (next precedence)
    if "*" in current and "**" not in current:
        # Find and evaluate 3 * 16 = 48
        current = current.replace("3 * 16", "48")
        steps.append(f"Multiplication: {current}")
    
    # Step 3: Handle addition (lowest precedence)
    if "+" in current:
        # Finally evaluate 2 + 48 = 50
        result = eval(current)  # Note: eval() is for demo only!
        steps.append(f"Addition: {result}")
    
    return steps, result

# Example usage
steps, final_result = evaluate_expression_step_by_step("2 + 3 * 4 ** 2")
for step in steps:
    print(step)
```


## Common Operator Precedence Patterns

Standard precedence rules that appear frequently in programming:

- **Mathematical Hierarchy:**\
  \(\text{Parentheses} > \text{Exponents} > \text{Multiplication/Division} > \text{Addition/Subtraction}\)

- **Comparison Chains:**\
  \(\text{Arithmetic} > \text{Comparisons} > \text{Boolean Logic}\)

- **Assignment Priority:**\
  \(\text{All Operations} > \text{Assignment Operators}\)

Python implementations demonstrating these patterns:

```python
def demonstrate_precedence_patterns():
    """Show common precedence scenarios"""
    
    # Mathematical precedence
    math_result = 2 + 3 * 4  # 14, not 20
    
    # Comparison chains
    age = 25
    is_adult = age >= 18 and age < 65  # True and True = True
    
    # Assignment happens last
    total = subtotal = 100 * 1.08  # Both variables get 108.0
    
    # Boolean operator precedence: not > and > or
    condition = not False and True or False  # (not False) and True or False = True
    
    return math_result, is_adult, total, condition

def safe_expression_evaluation(a, b, c):
    """Use parentheses to guarantee intended order"""
    # Ambiguous: what did we intend?
    unclear = a + b * c > a * b + c
    
    # Clear intentions with parentheses
    option1 = (a + b) * c > (a * b) + c
    option2 = a + (b * c) > (a * b) + c
    
    return unclear, option1, option2
```


## Practical Real-world Applications

Operator precedence isn't just academic - it's essential for real-world programming scenarios:

### Application 1: Financial Calculations

```python
def calculate_loan_payment(principal, annual_rate, years):
    """Calculate monthly loan payment with proper precedence"""
    # Formula: M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
    # Without parentheses, this would be completely wrong!
    
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
    num_payments = years * 12
    
    # Proper precedence crucial for financial accuracy
    numerator = monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate) ** num_payments
    denominator = (1 + monthly_rate) ** num_payments - 1
    monthly_payment = principal * (numerator / denominator)
    
    return monthly_payment

# Example: $200,000 loan at 5% for 30 years
payment = calculate_loan_payment(200000, 0.05, 30)
print(f"Monthly payment: ${payment:.2f}")
```

### Application 2: Data Processing Pipelines

```python
def process_sensor_data(raw_reading, calibration_offset, scale_factor):
    """Process sensor data with proper operation order"""
    # Common mistake: raw_reading + calibration_offset * scale_factor
    # This applies scale_factor only to offset, not the sum!
    
    # Correct approach with explicit parentheses
    calibrated_reading = (raw_reading + calibration_offset) * scale_factor
    
    # Additional processing with clear precedence
    filtered_reading = calibrated_reading if calibrated_reading > 0 else 0
    normalized_reading = filtered_reading / 100.0
    
    return normalized_reading

def validate_input_range(value, min_val, max_val, tolerance=0.01):
    """Validate with proper boolean precedence"""
    # Complex condition with clear precedence
    is_valid = (min_val <= value <= max_val and 
                abs(value - round(value)) < tolerance or
                value == min_val or value == max_val)
    
    return is_valid
```

### Application 3: Algorithm Implementation

```python
def binary_search_with_precedence(arr, target):
    """Binary search demonstrating operator precedence in algorithms"""
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        # Critical: proper precedence for midpoint calculation
        # Wrong: mid = left + right / 2  (only divides right by 2)
        # Right: mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1

def calculate_distance_formula(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """Distance formula requiring careful precedence"""
    # Formula: √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]
    # Parentheses crucial for correct calculation
    
    distance = ((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5
    return distance
```
