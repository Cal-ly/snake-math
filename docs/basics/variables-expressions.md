# Variables and Expressions

## Why Variables and Expressions Matter for Programmers

Variables and expressions are foundational in both mathematics and programming. They allow us to model, compute, and manipulate data effectively. Whether defining relationships, calculating values, or expressing logic, understanding how variables and expressions work empowers programmers to write clear, flexible, and efficient code.

## Understanding Variables and Expressions

In mathematics, **variables** represent unknown or changing values, and **expressions** describe relationships between them. A basic example:

$$
y = 2x + 1
$$

At first glance, this might seem cryptic — but in essence, it's just like writing a simple program. Variables in programming store values that may change, and expressions define how those values interact.

In statically-typed languages like C#, you'd declare the type of variable. In math, the "type" is often implied by context. Conceptually, both serve the same purpose: controlling and representing data.

You can also imagine variables as containers holding values and expressions as the instructions that operate on them:

```python
x = 5
y = 2 * x + 1
print(f"When x = {x}, y = {y}")
# Output: When x = 5, y = 11
```

Understanding variables and expressions helps bridge the gap between mathematical notation and programming logic.

## Variables and Expressions Techniques and Efficiency

### Method 1: Basic Variable Assignment

**Pros**: Simple and intuitive
**Complexity**: O(1)

```python
x = 5
y = 2 * x + 1
print(f"When x = {x}, y = {y}")
```

### Method 2: Using Loops to Explore Variables

**Pros**: Demonstrates flexibility with changing values
**Complexity**: O(n)

```python
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for x in values:
    y = 2 * x + 1
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
```

### Method 3: Defining Functions

**Pros**: Makes expressions reusable and modular
**Complexity**: O(1) per call

```python
def linear_function(x):
    return 2 * x + 1

print(f"f(10) = {linear_function(10)}")
```

---

## Why the Function Method Works

Encapsulating expressions as functions allows you to:

* Reuse logic without rewriting code
* Abstract complexity
* Make your code more readable and maintainable

```python
def explain_function():
    print("A function allows you to pass in x and get back y, without rewriting the expression each time.")

def linear(x):
    return 2 * x + 1

explain_function()
print(f"linear(7) = {linear(7)}")
```

## Common Variables and Expressions Patterns

* **Linear Expressions:**
  $y = mx + b$

* **Quadratic Expressions:**
  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$

* **Exponential Expressions:**
  $y = b^x$

```python
def linear(x, m=2, b=1):
    return m * x + b

def quadratic(x, a=1, b=0, c=0):
    return a * x**2 + b * x + c

def exponential(x, base=2):
    return base ** x
```

## Practical Real-world Applications

### Application 1: Temperature Conversion

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    return (9/5) * celsius + 32

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    return (5/9) * (fahrenheit - 32)

print(f"0°C = {celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)}°F")
print(f"100°F = {fahrenheit_to_celsius(100)}°C")
```

### Application 2: Compound Interest

```python
def compound_interest(principal, rate, time):
    return principal * (1 + rate) ** time

amount = compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 10)
print(f"$1000 at 5% for 10 years = ${amount:.2f}")
```

### Application 3: Distance and Speed

```python
def distance(speed, time):
    return speed * time

def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time

d = distance(60, 2.5)
print(f"Distance traveled: {d} miles")

s = speed(150, 3)
print(f"Average speed: {s} mph")
```
