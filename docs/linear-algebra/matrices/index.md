## Learning Path

Choose your starting point based on your experience:

- ðŸŸ¢ **New to matrices?** â†’ Start with [Fundamentals](basics.md)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Know basics, want efficiency?** â†’ Jump to [Operations & Systems](operations.md)
- ðŸ”´ **Ready for real applications?** â†’ Explore [Applications](applications.md)
- ðŸ“‹ **Need quick reference?** â†’ Browse this index for specific topics

## Key Mathematical Concepts

**Matrix Addition**: Element-wise addition of corresponding entries
```
(A + B)áµ¢â±¼ = Aáµ¢â±¼ + Báµ¢â±¼
```

**Matrix Multiplication**: Dot product of rows and columns
```
(AB)áµ¢â±¼ = Î£â‚– Aáµ¢â‚– Bâ‚–â±¼
```

**Transpose**: Flip rows and columns
```
(Aáµ€)áµ¢â±¼ = Aâ±¼áµ¢
```

These operations power everything from 3D graphics to machine learning algorithms!
