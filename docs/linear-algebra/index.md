## Quick Reference

### Essential Operations

| Operation | Notation | Description | Programming Use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Vector Addition** | $\vec{u} + \vec{v}$ | Component-wise addition | Data aggregation |
| **Dot Product** | $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ | Scalar result, measures alignment | Similarity measures |
| **Matrix Multiplication** | $AB$ | Linear transformation composition | Neural network layers |
| **Matrix Inverse** | $A^{-1}$ | Reverses transformation | Solving linear systems |

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Mathematical Form | Application |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Linear System** | $Ax = b$ | Solving equations, regression |
| **Transformation** | $y = Ax$ | Computer graphics, rotations |
| **Eigenvalue Problem** | $Ax = \lambda x$ | Principal component analysis |
| **Projection** | $\text{proj}_v u = \frac{u \cdot v}{v \cdot v}v$ | Dimension reduction |

### Key Formulas

**Vector Operations:**
- Magnitude: $\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2}$
- Dot product: $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \cdots + u_nv_n$
- Cross product: $\vec{u} \times \vec{v} = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)$

**Matrix Properties:**
- Determinant (2√ó2): $\det(A) = ad - bc$ for $A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$
- Matrix inverse: $AA^{-1} = I$ (identity matrix)
- Transpose: $(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}$
