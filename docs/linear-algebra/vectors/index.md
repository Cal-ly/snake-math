# Vectors and Operations

Think of vectors as arrows in space that point somewhere with purpose! They're like GPS directions that tell you both how far to go AND which direction to head. In programming, they're arrays with mathematical superpowers.

## Overview

Vectors are fundamental mathematical objects that represent quantities with both magnitude (size) and direction. They're essential for understanding physics, computer graphics, machine learning, and game development. From modeling velocity and force to representing data points in high-dimensional spaces, vectors are the building blocks of linear algebra.

## Key Mathematical Relationships

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Vector Addition: } \vec{u} + \vec{v} &= (u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, u_3 + v_3) \\
\text{Scalar Multiplication: } c\vec{u} &= (cu_1, cu_2, cu_3) \\
\text{Dot Product: } \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} &= u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3 \\
\text{Magnitude: } |\vec{u}| &= \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2} \\
\text{Cross Product: } \vec{u} \times \vec{v} &= (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)
\end{align}
