# Calculus

**Calculus** is the mathematics of change and motion. It provides tools to understand how quantities change over time, find optimal solutions, and analyze continuous systems. From optimizing machine learning algorithms to modeling population growth, calculus is fundamental to modern science and technology.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers the foundational concepts of calculus:

- **Mathematical analysis** - Understanding rates of change and accumulation
- **Computational methods** - Numerical approaches and implementations
- **Real-world applications** - From physics simulations to optimization algorithms
- **Programming integration** - Using calculus concepts in code

## Quick Reference

### Essential Concepts

| Concept | Notation | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Limit** | $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ | Value f(x) approaches as x approaches a |
| **Continuity** | $f$ continuous at $a$ | $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ |
| **Derivative** | $f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx}$ | Rate of change at a point |
| **Integral** | $\int f(x) dx$ | Area under curve or antiderivative |

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Mathematical Form | Programming Application |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Rate of Change** | $\frac{dy}{dt}$ | Velocity, acceleration in simulations |
| **Optimization** | $f'(x) = 0$ | Finding min/max in algorithms |
| **Area Calculation** | $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ | Numerical integration methods |
| **Growth Models** | $\frac{dy}{dt} = ky$ | Exponential growth/decay modeling |
