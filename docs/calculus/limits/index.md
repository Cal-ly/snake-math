# Limits and Continuity (lim, →)

Limits are like asking "What happens when we get really, really close?" - they're the mathematical way of describing behavior near a point without necessarily reaching it. Think of it as mathematical detective work that powers everything from smooth animations to machine learning optimization!

## Overview

Limits describe how functions behave as their inputs approach specific values, forming the foundation of calculus and numerical methods. This concept enables us to understand continuity, create robust algorithms, and solve complex mathematical problems in programming and data science.

## Module Structure

This section is organized into focused sub-topics for better learning:

## Quick Navigation

| Topic | Focus | Difficulty |
|-------|--------|------------|
| [Fundamentals](basics.md) | Core concepts and definitions | Beginner |
| [Methods](methods.md) | Calculation techniques | Intermediate |
| [Continuity](continuity.md) | Function behavior analysis | Intermediate |
| [Applications](applications.md) | Real-world implementations | Advanced |

## Key Concepts

- **Limit Definition**: $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ means f(x) approaches L as x approaches a
- **Continuity**: A function is continuous when $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$
- **L'Hôpital's Rule**: Systematic method for evaluating indeterminate forms
- **Numerical Limits**: Computational approaches when analytical methods fail

## Learning Path

1. **Start with [Fundamentals](basics.md)** to understand what limits represent
2. **Master [Methods](methods.md)** to learn calculation techniques  
3. **Explore [Continuity](continuity.md)** to analyze function behavior
