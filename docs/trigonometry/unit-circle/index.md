# Unit Circle and Trigonometric Functions

Think of trigonometric functions as the mathematical DNA of waves, rotations, and cycles! The unit circle is like a universal coordinate system where every angle tells a story through its x and y coordinates. It's the bridge between geometry and the rhythmic patterns that govern everything from sound waves to planetary motion.

Trigonometric functions relate angles to ratios in right triangles and coordinates on the unit circle (radius = 1, centered at origin). The unit circle is a powerful visualization tool that reveals how angles connect to coordinates and helps us understand the periodic nature of trigonometric functions.
