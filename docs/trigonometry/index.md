# Trigonometry

**Trigonometry** is the study of triangles and the relationships between their angles and sides. Beyond triangles, trigonometric functions describe waves, rotations, periodic phenomena, and oscillations that appear everywhere in nature and technology.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers trigonometric concepts from basic triangle relationships to advanced applications:

- **Triangle relationships** - Connections between angles and sides
- **Trigonometric functions** - Sine, cosine, tangent, and their properties
- **Periodic phenomena** - Waves, oscillations, and cyclic behavior
- **Computational applications** - Graphics, signal processing, and modeling

## Topics Covered

### ‚≠ï **[Unit Circle and Trigonometric Functions](./unit-circle/)**
The foundation of trigonometry through the unit circle approach

**What you'll learn:**
- Unit circle definition and coordinate interpretation
- Sine, cosine, and tangent function definitions
- Trigonometric identities and their derivations
- Angle measurement in radians and degrees
- Applications in programming and computer graphics

**Key concepts:**

## Quick Reference

### Essential Functions

| Function | Definition | Range | Period | Key Properties |
|----------|------------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Sine** | $\sin(\theta) = y$ | [-1, 1] | $2\pi$ | Odd function, starts at 0 |
| **Cosine** | $\cos(\theta) = x$ | [-1, 1] | $2\pi$ | Even function, starts at 1 |
| **Tangent** | $\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | $\pi$ | Odd function, undefined at odd multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ |

### Fundamental Identities

**Pythagorean Identity:**
- $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$

**Reciprocal Identities:**
- $\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$
- $\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}$
- $\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}$

**Angle Sum Formulas:**
- $\sin(\alpha \pm \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) \pm \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$
- $\cos(\alpha \pm \beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) \mp \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$

### Common Angles

| Angle (¬∞) | Angle (rad) | sin | cos | tan |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **0¬∞** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **30¬∞** | $\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ |
| **45¬∞** | $\frac{\pi}{4}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | 1 |
| **60¬∞** | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\sqrt{3}$ |
| **90¬∞** | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ | 1 | 0 | undefined |
