# Product Notation: Real-World Applications

## Overview

Product notation isn't just mathematical theory—it powers real-world applications from machine learning to financial modeling. This page explores practical implementations where multiplicative patterns create elegant solutions to complex problems.

## Machine Learning Applications

### Naive Bayes Classification

Product notation elegantly expresses the core mathematics of Naive Bayes classifiers:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
P(class|features) ∝ P(class) × ∏ᵢ P(featureᵢ|class)
```
