## Quick Reference

### Essential Formulas

| Type | Formula | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Natural Exponential** | $e^x$ | Base e ‚âà 2.718, continuous growth |
| **General Exponential** | $a \cdot b^x$ | Base b, initial value a |
| **Natural Logarithm** | $\ln(x) = \log_e(x)$ | Inverse of natural exponential |
| **Common Logarithm** | $\log_{10}(x)$ | Base 10, scientific notation |
| **Binary Logarithm** | $\log_2(x)$ | Base 2, computer science |
| **Change of Base** | $\log_b(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$ | Convert between bases |

### Key Properties

**Logarithm Rules:**
- $\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)$ (Product rule)
- $\log_b(x/y) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)$ (Quotient rule) 
- $\log_b(x^n) = n \log_b(x)$ (Power rule)
- $\log_b(1) = 0$ and $\log_b(b) = 1$ (Special values)

**Inverse Relationship:**
- $e^{\ln(x)} = x$ for x > 0
- $\ln(e^x) = x$ for all real x
- $b^{\log_b(x)} = x$ for x > 0, b > 0, b ‚â† 1

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Exponential Form | Logarithmic Form | Application |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Population Growth** | $P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}$ | $t = \frac{\ln(P/P_0)}{r}$ | Biology, demographics |
| **Radioactive Decay** | $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$ | $t = \frac{\ln(N_0/N)}{\lambda}$ | Physics, dating |
| **Compound Interest** | $A = P e^{rt}$ | $t = \frac{\ln(A/P)}{r}$ | Finance |
| **Algorithm Complexity** | $2^n$ operations | $\log_2(n)$ comparisons | Computer science |
