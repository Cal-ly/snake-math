## Quick Reference

### Essential Concepts

| Concept | Notation | Description | Programming Use |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Variable** | $x, y, z$ | Unknown values to solve for | Function parameters |
| **Function** | $f(x) = 2x + 1$ | Relationship between input and output | Code functions |
| **Equation** | $2x + 3 = 7$ | Statement of equality | Constraint solving |
| **Summation** | $\sum_{i=1}^n i$ | Add sequence of terms | Loop operations |

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Mathematical Form | Application |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
