# Linear Equations: Fundamentals

Think of linear equations as the foundation of predictable relationships! They're like mathematical GPS systems - they tell you exactly how one thing changes in relation to another at a perfectly constant rate. Whether you're predicting trends, balancing budgets, or training AI models, linear equations are your reliable mathematical workhorses.

## Understanding Linear Equations

A **linear equation** models relationships where change happens at a constant rate - like steady growth, uniform motion, or proportional scaling. In programming and data science, linear equations are the backbone of regression analysis, optimization algorithms, and system modeling.

A simple **linear equation** looks like:

$$ax + b = 0$$

with the solution:

$$x = -\frac{b}{a} \quad \text{(when } a \neq 0\text{)}$$

For **systems of linear equations** (multiple equations with multiple variables), solutions are intersection points where all equations are satisfied simultaneously:

$$\begin{cases}
a_1x + b_1y = c_1 \\
a_2x + b_2y = c_2
\end{cases}$$

Think of solving a system like finding where multiple straight lines cross on a graph - that intersection point satisfies all equations at once:

## Common Single Equation Patterns

Recognizing common patterns helps solve equations more efficiently:

### Pattern 1: Standard Form (ax + b = 0)
- **Example**: 3x - 12 = 0
- **Solution**: x = 12/3 = 4
- **Applications**: Direct calculations, simple modeling

### Pattern 2: Fraction Coefficients
- **Example**: (1/2)x + 3/4 = 0
- **Solution**: x = -3/4 ÷ 1/2 = -3/2
- **Tip**: Multiply by LCD to clear fractions

### Pattern 3: Decimal Coefficients  
- **Example**: 0.5x + 1.25 = 0
- **Solution**: x = -1.25/0.5 = -2.5
- **Tip**: Convert to fractions if precision matters

### Pattern 4: Variable on Both Sides
- **Example**: 2x + 5 = 3x - 7
- **Rearrange**: 2x - 3x = -7 - 5 → -x = -12 → x = 12
