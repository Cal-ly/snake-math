# Linear Equations (ax + b = 0)

Think of linear equations as the foundation of predictable relationships! They're like mathematical GPS systems - they tell you exactly how one thing changes in relation to another at a perfectly constant rate. Whether you're predicting trends, balancing budgets, or training AI models, linear equations are your reliable mathematical workhorses.

Linear equations model relationships where change happens at a constant rate - like steady growth, uniform motion, or proportional scaling. In programming and data science, linear equations are the backbone of regression analysis, optimization algorithms, and system modeling.
